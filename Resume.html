    <p>Hi, my name is Mary Buyco and I am a student in your WEB222 class.<br>
      I am a receptionist and an assistant at the accounting department of a car dealership that is located at Yonge and Steeles.<br>
    My experience from taking this course was alot of fun and alot of learning, albeit alot of trial and error.<br>
  I learned many things from taking this course, from the basics and fundamentals of working with HTML and CSS.<br>
  First time taking this course made me feel abit overwhelemed not because it was the hardest subject to learn but because it was new to me<br>
  and on top of that I had to also do other classes with other languages and rules.<br>
How ever I also learned how to be patient with learning. Obviously I know that I was not going to get everything right the first time <br>
, but taking this course has really helped with my time management skills since I have to take extra time to make sure what I do is correct. <br>
</P><br>
